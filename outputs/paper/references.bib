We examine patterns of economic security and insecurity across the life course, including the likelihood that Americans will experience poverty or near poverty, unemployment, the use of a social safety net program, or a combination of all three. We also estimate the likelihood of encountering another indicator of economic insecurity, asset poverty, and consider the probability of owning a home. We conclude that the ability to achieve long-term economic security across the life course has become challenging for many households. These developments threaten a fundamental bargain that is central to the American Dream: that economic security is the reward for hard work.Economic security is a key component of the American Dream.
